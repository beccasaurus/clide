Clide TODO ...

	Move FrameworkName from MooGet --> Clide.  Any project/framework related stuff can live in Clide

	PP generation will be in here too, which Moo can make good use of ...

	Also move Moo's CLI extension framework out so we can use it with Clide ...

Goal #1 ...

	# note, check out `rails help new`

	nvs new FooBar --template=X

		or use some build in templates ..

			nvs new FooBar -c|--console -w|--windows -l|--library


	so ...

		nvs new FooBar --console
		cd FooBar
		nvs build
		./bin/Debug/FooBar


		nvs test|spec ? ... ideal ... yes ... 

		SpecFlow plugin.


	Should our Moo extensions & filters be moved into another library so we can use them with Clide?  I think so?

We NEED nvs to be able to add a reference to source files from wherever (eg. a package!) ... that's our primary thing that we need for now!

SCM integration!  git and svn ...
